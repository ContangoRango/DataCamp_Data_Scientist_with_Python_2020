# Timing run of hierarchical clustering
# In earlier exercises of this chapter, you have used the data of Comic-Con footfall to create clusters. In this exercise you will time how long it takes to run the algorithm on DataCamp's system.

# Remember that you can time the execution of small code snippets with:

# %timeit sum([1, 3, 2])
# The data is stored in a Pandas data frame, comic_con. x_scaled and y_scaled are the column names of the standardized X and Y coordinates of people at a given point in time. The timeit module and linkage function are already imported

# How long does it take to the run the linkage function on the comic con data?

# Instructions
