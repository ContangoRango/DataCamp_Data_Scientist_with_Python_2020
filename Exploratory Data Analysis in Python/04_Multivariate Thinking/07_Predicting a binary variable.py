Predicting a binary variable
Let's use logistic regression to predict a binary variable. Specifically, we'll use age, sex, and education level to predict support for legalizing cannabis (marijuana) in the U.S.

In the GSS dataset, the variable grass records the answer to the question "Do you think the use of marijuana should be made legal or not?"
