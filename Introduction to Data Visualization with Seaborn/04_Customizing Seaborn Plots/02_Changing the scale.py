"""Changing the scale
In this exercise, we'll continue to look at the dataset containing responses from a survey of young people. Does the percentage of people reporting that they feel lonely vary depending on how many siblings they have? Let's find out using a bar plot, while also exploring Seaborn's four different plot scales ("contexts").

We've already imported Seaborn as sns and matplotlib.pyplot as plt.

Set the scale ("context") to "paper", which is the smallest of the scale options."""
# Set the context to "paper"
sns.set_context("paper")

# Create bar plot
sns.catplot(x="Number of Siblings", y="Feels Lonely",
            data=survey_data, kind="bar")

# Show plot
plt.show()

"""Change the context to "notebook" to increase the scale."""
# Change the context to "notebook"
sns.set_context("notebook")

# Create bar plot
sns.catplot(x="Number of Siblings", y="Feels Lonely",
            data=survey_data, kind="bar")

# Show plot
plt.show()

"""Change the context to "talk" to increase the scale."""
# Change the context to "talk"
sns.set_context("talk")

# Create bar plot
sns.catplot(x="Number of Siblings", y="Feels Lonely",
            data=survey_data, kind="bar")

# Show plot
plt.show()

"""Change the context to "poster", which is the largest scale available."""
# Change the context to "poster"
sns.set_context("poster")

# Create bar plot
sns.catplot(x="Number of Siblings", y="Feels Lonely",
            data=survey_data, kind="bar")

# Show plot
plt.show()
