# Complexity, bias and variance
# In the video, you saw how the complexity of a model labeled f^ influences the bias and variance terms of its generalization error.
# Which of the following correctly describes the relationship between f^'s complexity and f^'s bias and variance terms?

# Answer the question
# 50 XP

# Possible Answers

# As the complexity of f^ decreases, the bias term decreases while the variance term increases.

# As the complexity of f^ decreases, both the bias and the variance terms increase.

# As the complexity of f^ increases, the bias term increases while the variance term decreases.

# As the complexity of f^ increases, the bias term decreases while the variance term increases.
