Overfitting and underfitting
In this exercise, you'll visually diagnose whether a model is overfitting or underfitting the training set.

For this purpose, we have trained two different models A and B on the auto dataset to predict the mpg consumption of a car using only the car's displacement (displ) as a feature.

The following figure shows you scatterplots of mpg versus displ along with lines corresponding to the training set predictions of models A and B in red.

Which of the following statements is true?"""
# Possible Answers
# A suffers from high bias and overfits the training set.

# A suffers from high variance and underfits the training set.

# B suffers from high bias and underfits the training set.

# B suffers from high variance and underfits the training set.
